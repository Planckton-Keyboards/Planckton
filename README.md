# Planckton

Planckton is a budget, 100% DIY Planck clone. It has everything that makes the Planck great, but with a focus on costs and simplicity in the assembly.

Here are the specs for the current Planckton: 
* 48 1U key Ortholinear (2U spacebar not currently supported)
* [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware): the keyboard is fully programmable :)
